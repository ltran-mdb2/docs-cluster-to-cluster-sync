To reverse the direction of a sync operation, use the following
procedure to :ref:`commit your sync <c2c-cutover-process>` and call the
``reverse`` endpoint. 

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you can reverse your sync direction, you must configure
``mongosync`` and use the :ref:`c2c-api-start` endpoint to set the
following parameters:

- ``reversible`` to ``true``
- ``enableUserWriteBlocking`` to ``true``.

For more information on limitations and requirements of reversing sync,
see :ref:`c2c-api-reverse`. 

Steps
-----

Use these steps to reverse the direction of your sync:

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. include:: /includes/commit-process

   .. step:: Call the ``reverse`` endpoint.
   
      Call the ``reverse`` endpoint to reverse the direction of your sync 
      operation. Your original source cluster becomes your new destination cluster 
      and your original destination cluster becomes your new source cluster. 
      
      ``mongosync`` replicates all writes that you performed on your new
      source cluster after you unblocked writes (during step 4) to the
      new destination cluster.
